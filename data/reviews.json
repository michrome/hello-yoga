      "body": "Clare is a great yoga instructor, whether you‚Äôre just beginning or needing that extra push. Clare is very clear in her instructions, while also creating a calm and peaceful environment, making you come away from her class feeling like you‚Äôve done some physical effort and strangely relaxed at the same time! Couldn‚Äôt recommend Clare enough!"

      "body": "Myself and my mum have been going to Clare‚Äôs yoga sessions for some time. We both love it. Each session is always thorough with Clare always helping with positions if you can‚Äôt achieve them at first. Every session relaxes my body and mind. Calming my thoughts down from a bad day. I have noticed within myself that yoga helps my mental stability. Clare is one of the nicest, kindest and thorough instructors there are. She makes me and my mum very comfortable, understands & helps when you can‚Äôt achieve a position and guides you along each session. Clare‚Äôs yoga sessions are by far one of the best decisions I have made to make in a long time. ‚≠êÔ∏èüßöüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
